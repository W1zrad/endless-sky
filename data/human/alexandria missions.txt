			`You arrive on Earth and take a series of shuttles to get to Fez, Morocco, where you expect to meet Daemos Titan. As with all old cities, the outer regions are monstrous mega-buildings built in the last few centuries. The inner city is made of skyscrapers built from the 20th to 22nd centuries.`
			`	You turn a corner and see a rare sight for Earth: a large, green, field of grass with a beautiful mosque. It looks like something out of Earth's ancient history, perfectly preserved in present day.`
			choice
				`	(Enter the library.)`
			`	On your way to the library, a scruffy-looking man approaches you. He has a rather large gun in his holster, a massive book strapped to his back, and stares intently at you, or possibly through you. His dark red sunglasses and porcupine beard make it difficult to read or see his face. When the man abruptly stops walking, you consider yelling for help, fearing you're about to be mugged or shot.`
			`	Suddenly, he dives to the nearest bench, pulls the gigantic book off of his back, and starts jotting notes. You're not sure he even noticed you. His mind has wandered to whatever metaphysical world scholars occupy when reality has no bearing on their lives.`

				goto question
			label watch
			`	Between bouts of mumbling, reading, ranting, and writing, the man strokes his beard as if petting a cat. Eventually, his frantic scribbling on the giant book runs off the bottom of a page, and his pencil breaks. He is saddened for a moment, but then notices you.`
			`	His beard ruffles as he asks, "Yes?"`
			label question
			`	You ask, "Can you tell me where to find Daemos Titan?"`
			`	He looks baffled. "What would you do if you found him?"`
			`	"I was sent to help him find a book."`
			`	"Right, right. I asked the library for a second Seeker. Are you <last> <first>? Or was it <first> <last>? I'm so bad with names." He begins searching his belongings for another pencil.`
			`	"Captain <last> will do. Are you Daemos Titan?"`
			`	"Yes, yes, yes. I'll get ready to leave. Meet me in the spaceport this evening." He finds his second pencil and shoos you off.`

			`As Daemos guides you from the spaceport, you see a planet of anachronisms. In the high mountains, vast castles of medieval design house the ultra-rich, who live in a mock Victorian era. As you pass through the streets, you notice all the comforts of the modern era are concealed behind curtains: virtual reality booths, food-synthesizing devices, massive panel screens for tracking stocks, and the like. Outside the wealthy areas, you see the poor living no better than medieval serfs, using modern technology only in their workplaces.`
			`	Daemos isn't interested in any of that though; he rushes you on before you can fully take in the environment. You race through the cloud cities of the rich, beyond the factory towns, past the countryside, deep in a marsh, into a hidden temple, beneath a fake support column, and down into a subterranean room. In the center of the room, an impossibly old monk is meditating with his eyes closed. He hovers two feet above the ground humming in an almost guttural tone. Within his hands is a book.`
			choice
				`	(Approach the monk with Daemos.)`
			`	When Daemos approaches, the monk's eyes open, and he utters, "For the Seeker I do seek." He hands Daemos the book and then vanishes.`
			`	Daemos isn't surprised at all; he calmly puts the book in his satchel and hands you 60,000 credits.`
			`	"We have the Paq wa'DIch. Next, we seek the Paq cha'DIch." This seemed too easy for a 60,000 credit mission. You suspect the next four books will be harder to get. Meanwhile, Daemos wanders off to read the book. He probably won't listen to you for the next few hours. You return to the city and kill some time.`
